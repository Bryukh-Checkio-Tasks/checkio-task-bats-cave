    While searching for adventure on the island, our robotic trio found a creepy old bunker. 
    In the bunker, someone has hidden a rare and powerful computer chip which the robots hope to install on their spaceship.
    Our adventurous heroes have tried to search for this chip, but the bunker is occupied by scores robo-bats and the Alpha Bat appears to be in posession of the chip.
    In order to obtain the chip, the robots must capture Alpha Bat. 
    This is no easy feat though; the bunker is filled with bat scouts which will alert the others if they spot intruders.
    If we want to catch the Alpha Bat, we will need to know the amount of time it takes for the alert sent by the scount near the entrance to reach the Alpha Bat.
</p>

<p>
    We have the advantage, the bunker's walls do not reflect sound, so the alert signals can extend only in a straight line.
    The time it takes an alert to move between two bats is proportional to the Euclidean distance between cell centers (see the illustration).
    The time for the alert to travel between neighbouring cells is <strong>1 second</strong>.
    Alert "lines" cannot pass thought walls or corners.

</p>

<p>
    You are given the map of bunker as a list of strings:<br>
    "-" is an empty cell<br>
    "W" is a wall<br>
    "B" is a bat <br>
    "L" is the Alpha Bat <br>
    The entrance is placed at top left cell and here always a bat.
</p>

<p>
    You should calculate the minimal possible time for the alert to reach the leader with a precision of two digits.
